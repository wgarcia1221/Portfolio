# Wilbert Garcia's Portfolio

## Brainwashd

### **[Next.JS Misinformation Application](https://www.brainwashd.me)**

* Web application to analyze misinformation and disinformation built using Next.JS leveraging a hosted Python API that scrapes news articles and twitter posts for text content. Text content is then analyzed for potential biases and inaccuracies using the OpenAI API.

## Machine Learning 

### **[A* Star Search and Heurisitc Functions](https://github.com/wgarcia1221/Portfolio/tree/master/A%20Star%20Search%20%2B%20Heurisitics)**

* An implementation of the A star search algorithm along with three different heuristic functions in order to investigate the impact of the heuristic functions on search performance. This is done in order to optimize the solving of the 8 sliding tile puzzle. The folder also contains the accompanying paper describing the results of the research.

### **[American Sign Language Image Classification](https://github.com/wgarcia1221/Portfolio/tree/master/American%20Sign%20Language%20Image%20Classification)**

* Experimented with several deep learning transfer learning models available for image classification in order to perform multi-class classification on the dataset. The goal is to train a deep neural network that classifies the dataset and provides a model that accurately predicts the different letters of the sign language alphabet. The blog_post.ipynb file contains a detailed account of the experimental process and a clear overview of the coding done.

### **[Genetic Programming and Symbolic Regression](https://github.com/wgarcia1221/Portfolio/tree/master/Genetic%20Programming%20and%20Symbolic%20Regression)**

* Genetic Programming is used to implement Symbolic Regression. An Elitist method is used for parent selection. The folder also contains the accompanying paper describing the results of the research.

### **[Natural Language Processing: Insincere Questions Quora](https://github.com/wgarcia1221/Portfolio/tree/master/Insincere%20Questions%20Natural%20Language%20Processing%20)**

* Trained an LSTM model with F1 scores above .65 and attempted to train a DistilBERT transformer model which resulted in unclear results. The writeup.ipynb file contains a detailed account of the experimental process and a clear overview of the coding done.

### **[MNIST Digit Image Classification](https://github.com/wgarcia1221/Portfolio/tree/master/MNIST%20Digit%20Image%20Classification)**

* Implementation of densely-connected neural networks in order to solve classifying handwritten digits from MNIST dataset and also classifying a Kuzushiji dataset. with at least 95% accuracy.

### **[Pneumonia Chest X-Ray Image Classification](https://github.com/wgarcia1221/Portfolio/tree/master/Pneumonia%20X-Ray%20Chest%20Image%20Classification)**

* Experimented with different techniques available for Deep Learning image classification from building convolutional neural networks from scratch to using transfer learning models in order to perform binary classification on image dataset. The writeup.ipynb file contains a detailed account of the experimental process and a clear overview of the coding done.

## Web Development/Design

### **[QC EdConnect](https://qcedconnect.wixsite.com/mysite-1)**

* Designed and Built website for company in 24 hours that works to connect existing learning resources to disadvantaged students and families and to connect willing volunteers with opportunites to advocate and give. QC EdConnect is based in the Charlotte Mecklenburg area and came to fruition during the pandemic to prevent a further educational gap for disadvantaged students. Worked with cofounders to  and ensure that design and user experience serve the users.

### **[Data Management Dashboard](https://github.com/wgarcia1221/Portfolio/blob/master/Design%20Portfolio/SCC%20Dashboard.pdf)**

* Designed and Developed an R Shiny Dashboard for an organization looking to protect a historic black community of eldery residents in North Carolina from predatory housing practices. Collaborated with subject matter experts to anticipate client needs, and worked with peer to help ensure a simple and excellent experience for the user while satisfying the requirements of the client. 

### **[College Reopening Data Dashboard](https://github.com/wgarcia1221/Portfolio/blob/master/Design%20Portfolio/ATI.pdf)**

* Designed and Developed an R Shiny Dashboard for a private organization looking to analyze data on the reopening plans of institutions of higher education in response to the COVID 19 pandemic. This is an internal version of the [Davidson College Data Dashboard](https://collegecrisis.shinyapps.io/dashboard/) that was created for the American Talent Initiative. Worked with stakeholders to understand requirements and ensure that design and user experience serve the users. Created designs for scorecard to disseminate information simply and clearly relating to relevant metrics surrounding the reopening of schools. 

### **[Miscellaneous Designs](https://github.com/wgarcia1221/Portfolio/blob/master/Design%20Portfolio/Logos.pdf)**

* A variety of different logos/designs that I have been tasked with creating for a variety of different organizations.
